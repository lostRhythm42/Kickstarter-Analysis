# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.
Analyzing the results of various Kickstarter campaigns. The data in the sheet includes how much a campaign asked for, how much was raised, and if the project completed funding. The goal was to determine the best way to hold a Kickstarter for a play based in the US.

##Questions
The campaign for the play should be started in May, as Kickstarters lauched then seem to meet their goal more often. Kickstarters started during the holiday season seem to not do as well, most likely becuase most people are buying presents around that time and thus don't have the extra money to drop on a kickstarter that might not even get funded fully.

The funding total should not be too high, as that can prevent the goal from being reached. Lower goals have an easier time getting funded.
 
We can't see how long it took for a campaign to reach its goal. For the live campaigns, theres a possibility that backers could pull out at the last minute, meanng that results for funded campaigns could be higher than they really are. The data also doesn't account for campaigns where most of the money was donated by just one person.

We could make a graph that shows the average pledge amount for each campaign.
